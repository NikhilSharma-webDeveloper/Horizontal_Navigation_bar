# Horizontal_Navigation_bar
Here we we have two index files in which in the first one, I had made a Horizontal Navigation Bar with the help of just anchor tag but the only glich in this one we have that display: inline-block does create the small space between the elements 
On the second index files, I have created a Horizontal Navigation Bar with the help of unordered list and the anchor tag in it.
